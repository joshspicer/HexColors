# HexColors

HexColor is a simple iOS application written in Swift, written to introduce me to iOS development!
<br><br>
The user is provided multiple ways to manipulate 3 integer values representing an RGB color.  The color entered (either by sliders or by number) is then displayed as the background of the app.
<br><br>
This was built out of necessity and curiousity while working on a graphics project. I thought an app like this would be useful to quickly test color combos.  Similar apps on the App Store were paid, which inspired me to see if I could write such an application myself!
